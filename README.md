## Installation

To run this project you need python in a recent version and pip to install pygame(if you don't have it). Create a directory in the project folder and run it(the file path has to be complete, the one in the command is just an example):

```
cd Archer-PyGame
pip install pygame
& python C:/games/Archer-PyGame/main.py
```
Cd is for changing directory to the project folder. The pip install command is for installing the required package. The last command is to run main.py(note that you must use the full file path).
